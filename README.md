# Family Relationship Mapping

Using the N-nary tree data structure it creates a familuy tree.

-- This takes parents name and child name as input to, insert the child to the parent node.

-- If no parent present then it will not ask for parent name.

-- We can get the relationship between any two members just enter their name one after another, like: <strong>[name1] [name2]</strong>
    it will display the relation between them, like: <strong>[name1] is father of [name2]</strong>

-- We can also get the complete bloodline connection between any two members of the family tree.

-- We are using the csv file to store the family members data temporarily, just to display them while inserting a new child to tree for existing 
    parent names.

## Output

### Entering initial member into the family tree

-- The member doesn't have any parent, we call this member the <strong>Supreme</strong>
